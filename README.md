\# Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction Project



This project uses Python and an XGBoost model to predict the lifetime value of customers based on their purchase history (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value).



\## Files in this Repository

\* `ltv\_prediction\_script.py`: The main Python script with all the code.

\* `ltv\_xgb\_model.joblib`: The pre-trained machine learning model.

\* `ltv\_predictions.csv`: The final output file with customer IDs and their predicted LTV.
